# Grid World Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Grid World environment for reinforcement learning algorithms. The environment is a grid where an agent learns to navigate from a starting position to a goal position while maximizing rewards and minimizing penalties via a wide variety of algorithms.

## Project Goals

1) [] Design/Implement an Artificial Potential Controller to allow a mobile robotto follow/track a virtual moving target.
2) [] Write Matlab, Python, or C/Cpp code to implement your designed potential controller
3) [] Write a report of the project to cover the following items:
    * [] (50 points total) Noise free environment (robot is assumed to localize itself accurately without noise, and be able to sense target position accurately).
        * [] **(25 points) Plan the target to move in a linear/line trajectory and plot the tracking results:**
        1. [] trajectories of the target and robot
        2. [] tracking error between the target and robot
        3. [] robot’s heading
        4. [] robot’s velocity
        * [] **(25 points) Plan the target to move in the sine wave trajectory and plot the tracking results:**
        1. [] trajectories of the target and robot
        2. [] tracking error between the target and robot
        3. [] robot’s heading
        4. [] robot’s velocity
    * [] (50 points total) Noisy environment (robot is assumed to be able to sense the target, but with noise ). You can use Gaussian noise model (randn function), a similar noise function in the project 1.
        * [] **(25 points) Plan the target to move in a linear/line trajectory and plot the tracking results:**
        1. [] trajectories of the target and robot
        2. [] tracking error between the target and robot
        3. [] robot’s heading
        4. [] robot’s velocity
        * [] **(25 points) Plan the target to move in the sine wave trajectory and plot the tracking results:**
        1. [] trajectories of the target and robot
        2. [] tracking error between the target and robot
        3. [] robot’s heading
        4. [] robot’s velocity
    * [] Put all source code/software in the Appendix with instruction of running the code.

## Project Submission Files

The data files analyzed in the report are organized in a folder named `project_data`. The report itself is a .pdf file in the main directory named `Pinto CPE471 - Project 3 Report.pdf`. The `project_data` folder includes includes all the generated data used in the report. The `training_data` is where data generated by running the code is written to.

## Dependencies

This project requies a **Python** version of 3.12.9 or higher to run.
You are going to need the following dependencies for this project. Whether older version work or not are unknown as they have not been tested, but these were the versions used when developing this.

* **NumPy**: 2.2.2 or higher
* **Matplotlib**: 3.10.0 or higher

From the main directory, you can simply install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project from the main directory, just run the following command

```bash
python src/__main__.py
```

Once the projects starts, by default, it will in sequence:

## Configuration

The main configuration settings for the Grid World environment and reinforcement learning algorithms can be found in the `main` function. Below is a list of settings that you can customize:

You can modify these settings in the `main` function to suit your specific requirements. In future projects, the hope is to be able to read a JSON file with all these settings in one place as opposed to modifying the code itself.
